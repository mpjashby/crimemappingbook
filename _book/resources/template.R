# Replace this text with a short explanation of what this script does, e.g.
# 'This script produces a map of residential burglary in Lagos, Nigeria, in
# 2024'

# REMEMBER (you can delete this part of the code once you have read it)
# * Make sure your code follows all aspects of the Tidyverse style guide -- you
#   can use the styler package to help you with this.
# * Write a comment for each line of your code to explain what that code does
#   -- this will be useful to you in future if you need to come back to this
#   code later.
# * Write any temporary code (code that is needed to develop this script, but is
#   not needed for the script itself) in the R Console, not in this script.
# * Check your code by running `learncrimemapping::check_code()` and fixing any
#   issues that are reported **before you submit your script**.



# PREPARE ----------------------------------------------------------------------


## Load packages ----
# Use pacman to load *all* the packages you need for this script here. Do not
# load packages anywhere else in the script. Do not load packages that are not
# needed to run your code.


## Load and clean data ----
# Load all the data you will need here. If the data cannot be downloaded
# directly from a URL, make sure include the code needed to download the file to
# a local file first, then load the data from there. In this section you should
# also do any necessary initial cleaning of the data, e.g. to clean the column
# names.



# WRANGLE ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Do any other wrangling of the data that is required before you create one or
# more maps. If several different types of data wrangling are required, use
# header comments (like the line 'Load packages', above) to keep this section
# organised.



# VISUALISE --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create your maps, charts, etc. here. If you need to create multiple graphics,
# use header comments to keep this section organised. Remember to save the
# graphics you make using `ggsave()`.


# GENERATIVE AI DECLARATION ----------------------------------------------------
# Place the appropriate generative AI declaration here.
